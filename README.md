# Nmap Automation

Hi,
I'm a information security resercher and a newbie in Programming and Developement of tools used in Info-Sec Domain.

Just made this simple tool to make things easier for myself and many more like me. While using Nmap we often forget the scan flags/tags which are essential and can get you a mine of information about the target .

### -:- It does not require installation of any tool other than Nmap


##  How to use-
Simply git clone the repository and execute the below commands in the terminal.

```bash
cd NmapAutomation
sudo chmod +x Nmapautomation.sh
sudo ./Nmapautomation.sh

```
